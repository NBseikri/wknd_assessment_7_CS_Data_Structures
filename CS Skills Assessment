Part 1: Discussion Questions

Recursion

(1) In your own words, what is recursion?

Recursion is the process of a function calling itself. 

(2) Why is it necessary to have a base case?

Without a base case (i.e. a stopping point) a recursive function will continue
indefinitely.

Graphs

(1) What is a graph?

Graphs are similar to trees in that they model relationships amongst nodes. 
Relationships in graphs can be cyclical, directed or non-directed.

(2) How is a graph different from a tree?

Trees are acyclical and necessarily directional.

(3) Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.

Intestate succecssion (inheritance when a decedent died without a will) can be
modeled well by a graph as inheritance can travel up a family tree before
traveling downward to a family member who inherits. Intestate succession
can be cyclical and non-directed.
